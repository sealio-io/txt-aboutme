    <p class="aboutMeP">6/13/17<br/>Today as I was taking the surveys I almost forgot the 10-20-30 rule about presenting using powerpoints. It's suprising that I forgot it but that just tells me that I need to go over my notes more.</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/14/17<br/>Today is the first day of camp. I'm worried about how we'll sleep at night seeing how we're pretty much outside. The matresses look kinda dirty but I have my sleeping bag so no worries. Walking with Kevin was pretty interesting learning about what pushes him too learn new things was in a degree inspiring. I know his dreams need more tuning but I hope this program can help with that.</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/15/17<br/>Last night was extremely cold. I wore 2 socks and 2 pants just to stay warm while asleep. Also the bugs annoyed me a lot. I tried to take a show but I simply couldn't find one. The sleep I got was pretty bad. Hopefully tomorrow I'll be able to sleep easier. Playing the knot game was pretty stress full because no one would listen to the advice I would give them. But in the end they finally listened and so we finished the knot game with ease.</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/16/17<br/>Starting the lava game was pretty interesting. We weren't able to complete it today but I know for sure that by tomorrow we'll be able to complete it.</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/17/17<br/>As an Elite-Seal and being in the Lava game. I think it's safe to say that it was the equivelant to eating my own hair. None of the people in my group would listen to my advice and they would contantly repeat the same errors in some way or another. If the lils just listened to their fellow txters and coaches then we wouldn't have finished the game so late. But the thing in the end is that we actually got to finish the game. I hope that the lils can learning from this game. Also the sticks game was pretty quick in my opinion. I don't know if it was because I was sleepy but it just finished pretty quickly.</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/18/17<br/>Coming back from camp I'm feeling pretty lazy right now. All I'm gonna do today is sleep and watch anime. I'll be productive tomorrow.</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/19/17<br/>As I'm checking out Angular 2 it seems pretty intimidating. I hope that buy jumping in and learing the framework I'll be more cofident in my ability of using angular2.</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/20/17<br/>Funny thing just happened right now, So as I was installing angular 2 I ended up installing Angular 4. So now it looks like I'll be learning angular 4. I know I was told to learn angular 2 but why not learn angular 4? It looks a little easier than angular 2 anyways :/.</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/21/17<br/>In angular when defining a selector I learned that it doesnt have to be an element. It can be an attribute, class, or Id! I learned that when outputting data you can use the follow 2 techniques. String Interpolation - {{data}} and Property Binding - [property]="data". When you want to react to a user's click or anything the user interacts with you can use Event Binding - (event)="expression". A combination of both property binding and event binding is known as TWO-WAY-BINDING - [(ngmodel)]="data". Also in typescript when creating a variable your able to define what data type it is...reminds me of C++. You can do this by typing - varname : (number,string, etc.). Also I ran into the word "string interpolation" I think it means converting a data type to a string. I'll look more in depth to clarify.</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/22/17<br/>In string interpolation you can also intergrate functions like so - {{functionMyFunction()}}. Also I learned that you can actually disable html buttons using the 'disabled' attribute. A long with that I learned about the  ES6 arrow function [() => {}]. I always saw it in other people's js files but never understand it. Basicly all it does is intergrates the 'this' value into a function making writing out a function in some cases shorter and easier to write. Property binding in angular goes inside of html elements. [disabled]="!allowNewServer" the way that works is the element that has the disabled property will only have it enabled if the value "allowNewServer" is not false. I also learned that atom lags on these acers for no reason :slightly_smiling_face: (all other programs run well, atom is just being a butt)</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/23/17<br/>Atom wasn't working so today I didn't focuse on angular. For now I'll be looking a little bit into machine learning using pytthon. The method in which I trying to do machine learning was with linear regression. It's basicly just trying to draw a line that will pass through the most points on a coordinate plane.. I found a cool site https://www.quandl.com/ that allows you too use data for almost anything in your python,R,Excel, and other projects. I'm planning on using this site for my points in a coordinate plane I'll be making. As of right now though, learned how to create columns that display the data taken from Quandl. Other than that the majority of my day consisted of trying to fix atom. I learned that you can record profiles of cpu activity and then save the report as an actual file. The report has a .cpuprofile extension. When looking at the report I noticed that peg@parseTEXT seems to be what's congesting my cpu. Also when I open task manager for some reason I see a bunch of atom processes which is weird but I might have to do something with me having multiple files opened.</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/24/17<br/>So today I learned that you can put methods in string interpolation and not just variables. Square brackets in angular indicated property binding. Also ng-click has been replaced with (click). Essentially anything with ng-(x) has been turned into [x]. I also learned how to use *ngIf which allows someone to set a value to it and if that value/property is true then the element in which *ngIf is under will show. I also looked into classes in typescript, it's a bit confusing but once I start implementing it into my projects It should be easy to figure out.</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/25/17<br/>Today I learned about Async pipes in angular it subscribes to an Observable or Promise and returns the latest value it has emitted. Its usually placed the selector of your component and it looks like this "async-promise-pipe". But you can also use it with observables which is cool. I can see angular has some flexibility unlike some frameworks.</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/26/17<br/>I was researching how to build an AI with python and found seom pretty interesting things. I found out that there are a lot of packages that have to work together in order to create an AI (NumPy, scikit-learn, iPython Notebook, and matplotlib). One of the packages which I researched contain a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code (I never heard of intergrating 2 seperate languages but that's cool), useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities (which I have been researching to so extent, more on the linear algebra side).</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/27/17<br/>Today I learned about the setTimeout function built into javascript which allows you to write out a function that will execute after the param for time runs out. I also learned how to customize sublime's theme and how to add angular2 html syntax detection. In typescript when reassigning a variable's value in a funciton you must use the "this" property. $event gives us information about the event that occured in an html element. Also printing out the whole event will give you a huge object containing objects inside of objects. Also to get the property of the event object in typescript you must tell typescript that "event" is from an html input [ex. <code> (<HTMLInputElement>event.target)]</code>. Directives are instructions in the DOM. TO create a directive you must write @Directive{}, just like how you would create component. So an example of a directive in use would be *ngIf. The * means that ngIf is a structural directive (changes the structure of the dom).</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/28/17<br/>I learned that Ng-template is a component/directive shipped with angular. The #'name' attribute in angular marks a certain place in the template that you want to show conditionally. I also learned how to create animations using JQUERY. I also focused on AI and read/watched things about AI so I can wrap my head around what I can create as a product for TxT. Besides that I've spent a lot of time trying to fix an angular problem I'm having.</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/29/17<br/>I did some research and wrote my own 'research paper' <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t8_3ex3jflPzBcyKkXSBsuMNwg9C04EcsxbrGf9y66A/edit?usp=sharing">AI Research Paper</a></p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">6/30/17<br/>Today I was researching how google home works and I found out that it uses api.ai for it's voice recognition features. Taking that into account I'll plan use that api after I get a facial recognition project I'm working on to work. So far I've found out how to display my webcam onto a website and now the only part is left is getting my face to be detected. I'm planning on usingjs-objectdetect.</p>

    <p class="aboutMeP">7/1/17<br/>Today I learned that chrome needs to be locally in order to locally access media files such as your webcam. But firefox allows you to access media files without having to host locall. I also learned how to uninstall a package and then clear the npm cache and then reinstall a package. Again I spent a lot of my angular learning time trying to fix an <code><ng-template></code> error so I haven't learned any new angular syntax yet. But I did research Decision trees and briefly went over how to incorporate them into python.A decision tree is essentially a model of if, else-if, and else statements. Only difference to me is that it’s shown visually as the branches of a tree growing instead of blocks of codes. he decision tree much resembles the thought process of a human being which makes it easy for developers to read and follow. Using decision trees allow to know exactly why the computer made the decision it made unlike other classifiers. and that is why it’s being used for machine learning.</p>
